### **Important Topics for Interviews (JavaScript)**

#### **High-Priority Topics:**
1. **JavaScript Fundamentals**:
   - **Data Types**: Understanding of primitive vs. reference types, type coercion, and type checking.
   - **Functions**: Function declarations, expressions, arrow functions, closures, and `this` binding.
   - **Arrays & Objects**: Array methods (e.g., `map`, `filter`, `reduce`) and object manipulation.
2. **Asynchronous JavaScript**:
   - **Callback Functions**: Understanding callback functions and callback hell.
   - **Promises**: How to handle asynchronous operations with promises, chaining, and error handling.
   - **Async/Await**: Using async/await to simplify handling promises.
3. **DOM Manipulation**:
   - **DOM Traversal and Event Handling**: Adding event listeners, event delegation, and manipulating the DOM dynamically.
4. **JavaScript Design Patterns**:
   - Singleton, Factory, and Module patterns.
5. **JavaScript Closures**:
   - How closures work and common use cases in JavaScript.
6. **Error Handling**:
   - Using `try`, `catch`, and `finally` to handle errors, and creating custom error objects.
7. **ES6 Features**:
   - Destructuring, spread/rest operators, arrow functions, template literals, and `let`/`const`.
8. **JavaScript Testing**:
   - Writing unit tests with Jest or Mocha, mocking dependencies, and handling asynchronous code in tests.

#### **Medium-Priority Topics:**
1. **JavaScript Performance Optimization**:
   - Techniques like debouncing and throttling for improving performance.
2. **JavaScript Frameworks**:
   - **React.js**: State, props, hooks, and components lifecycle.
   - **Vue.js**: Reactivity, Vue instance, and Vue Router.
   - **Angular**: Components, directives, RxJS.
3. **JavaScript Build Tools**:
   - **Webpack** for bundling, **Babel** for transpiling, **NPM/Yarn** for package management.
